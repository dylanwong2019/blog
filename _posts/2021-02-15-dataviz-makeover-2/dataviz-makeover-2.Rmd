# A. Critiques

## Clarity

1. The title of the 100% stacked bar chart on the left is misleading as the visualisation does not show which country is more pro-vaccine clearly. Viewers may not be able to understand intuitively what the surveyees were agreeing or disagreeing to.
1. While it is pleasant that the right bar chart has been sorted in descending order to allow better reading experience, the order of the countries on the y-axis of both bar charts are not synchronised - the chart on the left is sorted alphabetically. viewers may be confused as to why the 2 charts are placed side by side, and they may second-guess whether the author is trying to make some sort of comparison.
1. The right bar chart is essentially just the extraction of the percentage of "strongly agree", which has already been shown in the 100% stacked bar chart on the left. To achieve the same intent, the left bar chart could have been sorted  in descending order by the "Strongly agree", and with the "Strongly agree" bars aligned to the left - against the y-axis. Viewers may be confused by the redundant chart created.
1. The rationale as to why the focus is only on those who strongly agreed is unclear. "Agree" is also a positive response to the willingness to get vaccinated.
1. The confidence interval, which is the margin of error that tells reader how much the survey results would be reflective of the view of the overall population, is missing. Viewers should be kept informed
1. The legend shows only "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree". It is up to viewers' own interpretation of what the other 3 colours are referring to.
1. The Likert scale used is rather unconventional. The ratings/ score is usually assigned in a progressive manner, i.e. higher rating denotes better or more positive response than the preceding value. The case here is opposite where "1" is assigned to "Strongly Agree" and "5" being assigned to "Strongly Disagree".


## Aesthetics

1. The word "vaccine" on the title of the left bar chart is misspelt as "vacinne" - not what viewers would expect from the English standard of research scientists from Imperial College London.
1. It is not clear what the legend title "Vac 1" is referring to.
1. The numbers on the legend is redundant as what really matters is to explain what each bar colour represents.
1. The colour scheme used in the left bar chart helps viewers to easily identify the different segments in the stacked bar chart. However, the colour choice could be further improved. For example, red typically denotes negative sentiment while green for positive sentiment. Therefore, the use of red for "not sure" and green for "strongly disagree" is not ideal.
1. While it is a commendable effort to zoom in on the "strongly agree" with the bar chart on the right to allow the viewers to understand the percentage of the survey population who strongly agree to vaccination, which explains the un-synchronised x-axis scale, it is unfortunate that the x-axis maximum bound ended abruptly at "60%". As a result, viewers may not be able identify the percentage value for United Kingdom.
1. Names of countries are proper nouns and so the first letter of the names of countries should always be capitalised.

# B. Proposed Improvement and Data Visualisation

## Clarity

1. The chart title should be changed to better reflect the survey question asked. Since there are other questions asked to 
1. If 2 charts of similar y-axis are to be placed side by side, the order of the countries should be synchronised.
1. Since the bar chart on the right is essentially redundant, replace it with an error bar on dot plot chart to help viewers visualise the uncertainty.
1. Include the missing legend names for rating 2 to 4, i.e. 2 = Agree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Disagree


## Aesthetics

1. Visualise the Likert scale survey using diverging stacked bar chart. It helps viewers to better visualise the sentiments or desires of the surveyees with a common vertical baseline.
1. Recode the names of countries to capitalise the first letter.
1. Improve the colour scheme to group similar responses together, e.g. different shade of the same colour for "Strongly Agree" and "Agree" to denote similar sentiment.
1. Remove the legend title as the legend itself is self-explanatory.

## Proposed Data Visualisation

# C. Data Visualisation in Tableau

# D. Preparation of Data Visualisation

## 1. Data Preparation

* The data use for this visualisation was downloaded from [Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker) hosted on Github.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Data Source.png){width=100%}

* From the upload history of the repository, it was observed that the files were last updated at different period ranging from few hours ago to 5 months ago. Since the research is to focus on survey conducted in January 2021, files updated after and before January 2021 are excluded. The data of Australia, Canada, Denmark, France,     Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom were used for the visualisation.

* Using Tableau Prep Builder, the australia.csv file was first dragged directly from the folder into the Tableau Prep Builder window.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Prep Builder.png){width=100%}

* To merge the data files of the other countries, make sure that the files are save in the same location as australia.csv. Thereafter, in Tableau Prep Builder, select the Multiple Files tab > Wildcard union > Apply

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Union.png)
    
* From the right panel, it was observed that the data has many variables. Referring to the codebook.xlsx file, identify the variables to be retained and leave them checked. One could either first uncheck all fields then manually check the fields needed, or leave all fields checked and manually uncheck the fields not needed. For this visualisation exercise, the fields selected are: _endtime_, _household_children_, _age_, _gender_, _household_size_, _employment_status_, _vac_1_, _vac2_1_, _vac2_2_, _vac2_3_, _vac2_6_, _vac_3_, _employment_status_1_, _employment_status_2_, _employment_status_3_, _employment_status_4_, _employment_status_5_, _employment_status_6_, _employment_status_7_, _File Paths_.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Sample Data.png)
    
* Referring to _codebook.xlsx_, the original field names are as follow:
    
    Variables|Original Field Names
    :-|:----
    _endtime_|When did you complete this question (epoch seconds)?
    _household_children_|Number of children under 18 in household
    _age_|Age
    _gender_|Gender
    _household_size_|Number of people in household
    _employment_status_|Employment Status
    _vac_1_|If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it
    _vac2_1_|I am worried about getting COVID19
    _vac2_2_|I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine
    _vac2_3_|I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine
    _vac2_6_|If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it|
    _vac_3_|If a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available to me a year from now, I definitely intend to get it
    _employment_status_1_|Full time employment
    _employment_status_2_|Part time employment
    _employment_status_3_|Full time student
    _employment_status_4_|Retired
    _employment_status_5_|Unemployed 
    _employment_status_6_|Not working
    _employment_status_7_|Other
    _File Paths_|File Name (Country)

* Next, click on the "*+*" sign beside connected data and add a *Clean Step* to apply the variables selection.

    <center>![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean.png)</center>
    
* Under *Clean 1* step, frequency distributions of each variables could be observed. To ensure that the eventual visualisation is limited to data collected in January 2021 only, the _endtime_ was filtered by clicking on the 3 dots button *"..."* > *Filter* > *Range of Dates*

    <center>![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean2.png)</center>
    
    The minimum date was set at 01/01/2021. Since from the frequency distribution it was observed that there are no data collect beyond January 2021, a maximum date need not be inputted.
    
    <center>![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean3.png)</center>

* It was also observed that the datas sets from several countries have separate fields for respondents to respond to the question on their employment status, i.e. _employment_status_1_, _employment_status_2_, _employment_status_3_, _employment_status_4_, _employment_status_5_, _employment_status_6_, _employment_status_7_. A calculated field was created to harmonise these fields into one. After clicking on *Create Calculated Field...*, input the formula shown below to consolidate the different variables for employment status.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean4.png){width=100%}
    
* _File Paths_ was renamed to _Country_

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean5.png)
    
* Finally, export the data by creating an *Output* step. Click on the the "*+*" button beside Clean 1 and select *Output*. 

    <center>![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean6.png)</center>
    
    In the *Output*, select the preferred savings option and click on *Run Flow*.
    
    <center>![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/01 Clean7.png)</center>
    
## 2. Loading of Data

* Open up Tableau, click on *Text file* and locate the _Cleaned.csv_ file exported from Tableau Prep Builder

     ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/02 Loading.png){width=100%}

* Minor clean up here before the visualisation

    Hide away unnecessary columns, i.e. _employment_status_1_, _employment_status_2_, _employment_status_3_, _employment_status_4_, _employment_status_5_, _employment_status_6_, _employment_status_7_
     
    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/02 Hide.png){width=100%}
     
    Right-click on the Country column, and select *Aliases..*.
    
    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/02 Country.png)
    
    Edit the country names - removing ".cvs" and capitalising first letter
    
    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/02 Aliases.png)

## 3. Creating Diverging Stacked Bar Chart

* To create the diverging stacked bar chart, the vaccine related survey questions, i.e. _vac_1_, _vac2_1_, _vac2_2_, _vac2_3_, _vac2_6_, _vac_3_, are pivoted. Highlight the columns, right-click, and select *Pivot*. 

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Survey Questions.png)

* Next, double-clock on the column names and change it to "Survey Questions" and "Score" as shown.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Score.png)
    
* Right-click on the _Survey Questions_ column and select *Aliases..*. Update the Value of the field names to the actual questions.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Vaccine Aliases.png)
    
* Similarly for _Score_, update the aliases.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Score Aliases.png)
    
* Create a calculated field to assign an integer value to each score and name is _Score Value_.

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Score Value.png)

* Create 7 other calculated fields using the formula shown:

    Fields|Formula
    :-|:----
    Number of Records|1
    Total Count|Total(SUM([Number of Records]))
    Count Negative|IF [Score Value]<3 THEN 1 ELSEIF  [Score Value]=3 THEN 0.5 ELSE 0 END
    Total Count Negative|TOTAL(SUM([Count Negative]))
    Percentage|SUM([Number of Records])/[Total Count]
    Gantt Start|-[Total Count Negative]/[Total Count]
    Gantt Percent|PREVIOUS_VALUE([Gantt Start])+ZN(LOOKUP([Percentage],-1))
    
* Drag _Gantt Percent_ from the left panel into Columns _Country_ into Rows, and _Score Value_ into Detail

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Diverging1.png)

* From the dropdown menu of _Gantt Percent_, select *Compute Using* > *Score Value*
  
    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Diverging2.png) 
    
* Next, change the chart type to Gantt Chart, drag from the left panel _Score Value_ into Color, and _Percentage_ into Size 

    ![](/ISSS608/blog/_posts/2021-02-15-dataviz-makeover-2/image/03 Diverging3.png) 
    
* Double-click on the color palette on the top right corner, and adjust the color appropriately.
