title: "DataViz Makeover 2"
description: |
  A critique and proposed makeover of the data visualisation created by a research team to understand the willingness of the public on COVID-19 vaccination. The data used by the research team was obtained from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub hosted at Github (https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker).

# A. Critiques

## Clarity

1. The title of the 100% stacked bar chart on the left is misleading as the visualisation does not show which country is more pro-vaccine clearly. Viewers may not be able to understand intuitively what the surveyees were agreeing or disagreeing to.
1. While it is pleasant that the right bar chart has been sorted in descending order to allow better reading experience, the order of the countries on the y-axis of both bar charts are not synchronised - the chart on the left is sorted alphabetically. viewers may be confused as to why the 2 charts are placed side by side, and they may second-guess whether the author is trying to make some sort of comparison.
1. The right bar chart is essentially just the extraction of the percentage of "strongly agree", which has already been shown in the 100% stacked bar chart on the left. To achieve the same intent, the left bar chart could have been sorted  in descending order by the "Strongly agree", and with the "Strongly agree" bars aligned to the left - against the y-axis. Viewers may be confused by the redundant chart created.
1. The rationale as to why the focus is only on those who strongly agreed is unclear. "Agree" is also a positive response to the willingness to get vaccinated.
1. The confidence interval, which is the margin of error that tells reader how much the survey results would be reflective of the view of the overall population, is missing. Viewers should be kept informed
1. The legend shows only "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree". It is up to viewers' own interpretation of what the other 3 colours are referring to.


## Aesthetics

1. The word "vaccine" on the title of the left bar chart is misspelt as "vacinne" - not what viewers would expect from the English standard of research scientists from Imperial College London.
1. It is not clear what the legend title "Vac 1" is referring to.
1. The numbers on the legend is redundant as what really matters is to explain what each bar colour represents.
1. The colour scheme used in the left bar chart helps viewers to easily identify the different segments in the stacked bar chart. However, the colour choice could be further improved. For example, red usually denotes negative sentiment while green for positive sentiment. Therefore, the use of red for "not sure" and green for "strongly disagree" is not ideal.
1. While it is a commendable effort to zoom in on the "strongly agree" with the bar chart on the right to allow the viewers to understand the percentage of the survey population who strongly agree to vaccination, which explains the un-synchronised x-axis scale, it is unfortunate that the x-axis maximum bound ended abruptly at "60%". As a result, viewers may not be able identify the percentage value for United Kingdom.
1. Names of countries are proper nouns and so the first letter of the names of countries should always be capitalised.

# B. Proposed Improvement and Alternative Data Visualisation

## Clarity

1. Use a title that better reflects the survey question asked.
1. If 2 charts of similar y-axis are to be placed side by side, the order of the countries should be synchronised.
1. Since the bar chart on the right is essentially redundant, replace it with an error bar on dot plot chart to help viewers visualise the uncertainty.
1. Include the missing legend names for rating 2 to 4.


## Aesthetics

1. Visualise the Likert scale survey using diverging stacked bar chart. It helps viewers to better visualise the sentiments or desires of the surveyees with a common vertical baseline.
1. Recode the names of countries to capitalise the first letter.
1. Improve the colour scheme to group similar responses together, e.g. different shade of the same colour for "Strongly Agree" and "Agree" to denote similar sentiment.
1. Remove the legend title as the legend itself is self-explanatory.
